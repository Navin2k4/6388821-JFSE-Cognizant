# Design Principles and Patterns

This module introduces learners to essential design principles and patterns that are crucial for creating
robust and maintainable software. Learners will delve into the SOLID principles, which include SRP, OCP,
LSP, ISP, and DIP. They will also explore common design patterns, such as Creational, Structural, and
Behavioral patterns, which provide reusable solutions to common design challenges. The module
combines theoretical insights with practical exercises, helping learners understand and apply these
concepts in their projects, ultimately enhancing their ability to write clean, efficient, and scalable code.

## Topics To Learn

### 1. SOLID Principles (Object-Oriented Design)

- **S** – _Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)_
- **O** – _Open/Closed Principle (OCP)_
- **L** – _Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)_
- **I** – _Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)_
- **D** – _Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)_
